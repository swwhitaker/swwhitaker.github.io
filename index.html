<p id= "boxed">Welcome to my gradually improving page about landscape and travel photography! I have created this page as an assignment to learn more about html and to play with creating content, so it will be getting better as I progress. The twin foci of this page are landscape and travel photography because they are the two kinds of photography I enjoy doing, and because they share a sense of trying to translate the feeling of being in a remarkable setting into an image that can be a touchstone of memory for me and can communicate as much as possible about what makes that setting remarkable to others.</p>

	<h2>One of My Favorite Landscape Photography Pages</h2>
<p id="boxed"> One of my favorite landscape photography pages and a good source of inspiration is <a href="https://www.joshuacripps.com/">Joshua Cripps Photography.</a></p> 
<p id="boxed">I have been enjoying this page for years for several reasons:  
<ul>
<li>The quality of the portfolio is stellar. I really enjoy viewing the lanscape photography galleries. </li>
<li>The video courses and tips and tutorials pages are a great mix of free introductory content as well as useful paid content to guide other burgeoning landscape photographers in important aspects of the craft like processing, field work, equipment, composition. 
<li> It includes a great blog with sharable content that I see on social media and it keeps me coming back. </li>
<li>Joshua has put out some great ebooks, and offers samples <em>gratis</em>.</li> 
</ul><p>
