<h1 style="font-family:verdana;">About Me</h1>
<p>I've been photographing for pleasure for over thirteen years, and enjoy traveling and capturing beauty abroad, but equally enjoy finding scenes ranging from the quiet and serene to the grand and spectacular in Vermont, where I have lived for three years. I also work in sales and marketing professionally, although I spent six years of undergraduate and graduate school studying antiquity and several dead languages. Throughout it all, photography has been my go-to refuge and creative outlet.</p>
